#### Instantiate the Kinetic Client

The Kinetic Client will give you access to all the methods you need to work with Kin on the blockchain.

We recommend starting with Devnet before moving on to Mainnet.

```csharp
sdk = await KineticSdk.Setup(
	new KineticSdkConfig(
		endpoint: "https://sandbox.kinetic.host/",
		environment: 'devnet',
		index:1,
	)
);
```
Don't have an App Index? Register your App on our Developer Portal so you can get your App Index that allows you to transact with our SDKs and earn via the KRE.


#### Create Account
You can create accounts from existing mnemonics or secret keys. In this case we'll generate a mnemonic and use that to create the keypair we use for creating the account on the blockchain.

```csharp
var mnemonic = Keypair.GenerateMnemonic();
var keypair = Keypair.FromMnemonic(mnemonic);
await sdk.CreateAccount(keypair);
```
#### Check Balance
```csharp
var balance = await sdk.GetBalance(keypair.PublicKey);
```
#### Airdrop Funds (devnet)
```csharp
await sdk.RequestAirdrop( account: keypair.PublicKey, amount: "1000" );
```
#### Transfer Kin
```csharp
await sdk.MakeTransfer(
	amount: "5000",
	destination: "BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MAqVo",
	owner: keypair,
	type: TransactionType.P2P // Can be Unknown, None, Earn, Spend or P2P
);
```

#### Get Transaction Details
```csharp
await sdk.GetTransaction(signature: transactionSignature);
```

#### Get Account History
```csharp
    await sdk.GetHistory(account: keypair.PublicKey);
```
