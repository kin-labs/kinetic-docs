# Kinetic TypeScript SDK

Learn how to use the Kinetic TypeScript SDK


# Installation

```shell
yarn add @kin-kinetic/sdk @kin-kinetic/keypair @kin-kinetic/solana
```

## Initialize SDK

Initialise the SDK so that you have access to all of Kinetic's methods.

```ts
import { KineticSdk, KineticSdkConfig } from '@kin-kinetic/sdk'

// Note - this example is using a demo app on the Kinetic Sandbox provided by the Kin Foundation.
const config: KineticSdkConfig = {
	endpoint: 'https://sandbox.kinetic.host',
	environment: 'devnet',
	index: 1
}
// Note - Setting up the Kinetic SDK is an async action
const sdk: KineticSdk = await KineticSdk.setup(config)
```
If you're self-hosting Kinetic, you can include an optional endpoint value pointing at your server.

Here's the config Type for reference:
```ts
export interface KineticSdkConfig {
    index: number;
    endpoint: string;
  	environment: KineticSdkEnvironment;
    headers?: Record<string, string>;
    logger?: KineticSdkLogger;
    solanaRpcEndpoint?: string;
}
```

## Generate a Keypair

A Keypair contains a 'secretKey' that you can use to sign transactions and a 'publicKey' that you can use as an address for paying towards or checking a balance, etc.

Using `Keypair.random()` will also return a mnemonic that you can use to recreate you wallet in other applications / wallets should you choose to do so.
```ts
import { Keypair } from '@kin-kinetic/keypair'

const keypair = Keypair.random()
const { mnemonic, secretKey, publicKey } = keypair;
```
## Create a Kin Account
Use your keypair to create your account on the Solana blockchain.
```ts
const account = await sdk.createAccount({ owner: keypair })
```
Generate your keypair from your mnemonic for an existing account:
```ts
const keypair = Keypair.fromMnemonic(mnemonic);
```

## Use the SDK with the Keypair

### Get the balance
Use a publicKey to check your Kin balance.

```ts
const balance = await sdk.getBalance({ account: keypair.publicKey })
```

### Request an Airdrop
Send Kin to a publicKey on the Solana devnet.

Airdrops take some time to complete as we make sure the transaction has been confirmed on the blockchain before returning a response.

```ts
const signature = await sdk.requestAirdrop({ account: keypair.publicKey, amount: '1000' })
```

### Make a Transfer
Send Kin from a Keypair (as you need the privateKey) to a publicKey on the blockchain.

You can optionally set the commitment level before returning ('Confirmed', 'Finalized' or Processed), the transaction type, or add a referenceId / referenceType.

```ts
const result = await sdk.makeTransfer({
  	amount: "42",
	destination: "ALisrzsaVqciCxy8r6g7MUrPoRo3CpGxPhwBbZzqZ9bA",
	owner: keypair,
})
```
Here's the makeTransfer Type for reference:
```ts
export interface TransferDestination {
    amount: string
    destination: PublicKeyString
}
export interface MakeTransferOptions extends TransferDestination {
    commitment?: Commitment;
    mint?: string;
    owner: Keypair;
    referenceId?: string;
    referenceType?: string;
    senderCreate?: boolean;
    type?: TransactionType;
}
```
