# Mogami TypeScript SDK

Learn how to use the Mogami TypeScript SDK


# Installation

```shell
yarn add @mogami/sdk @mogami/keypair @mogami/solana 
```

## Initialize SDK

You need to initialise the SDK so that you have access to all of Mogami's methods.
```ts
import { MogamiSdk,MogamiSdkConfig } from '@mogami/sdk'

const config: MogamiSdkConfig = {
	environment: 'devnet',
	index: 1
}
const sdk: MogamiSdk = await MogamiSdk.setup(config)
// Note - Setting up the Mogami SDK is an async action
```

## Generate a Keypair

A Keypair contains a 'secretKey' that you can use to sign transactions and a 'publicKey' that you can use as an address for paying towards or checking a balance, etc.

If you use a mnemonic to generate your keypair, you'll be able to use that mnemonic to recreate your wallet in other applications / wallets should you choose to do so.
```ts
import { Keypair } from '@mogami/keypair'

const mnemonic = Keypair.generateMnemonic()
const keypair = Keypair.fromMnemonicSet(mnemonic)[0]
```

## Use the SDK with the Keypair

### Get the balance
Use a publicKey to check your Kin balance.

```ts
const balance = await sdk.balance(keypair.publicKey)
```

### Request an Airdrop
Send Kin to a publicKey on the Solana devnet.

Airdrops take some time to complete as we make sure the transaction has been confirmed on the blockchain before returning a response. 

```ts
const signature = await sdk.requestAirdrop(keypair.publicKey, "42000")
```

### Make a Transfer
Send Kin from a Keypair (as you need the privateKey) to a publicKey on the blockchain.

You can optionally set the commitment level before returning ('Confirmed', 'Finalized' or Processed), the transaction type, or add a referenceId / referenceType. 

```ts
const result = await sdk.makeTransfer({
  amount: "42",
	destination: "ALisrzsaVqciCxy8r6g7MUrPoRo3CpGxPhwBbZzqZ9bA",
	owner: keypair,
})
```
